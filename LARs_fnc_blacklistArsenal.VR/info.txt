JIPID = [ OBJECT, [ WHITELIST, BLACKLIST ], TARGETS, NAME, CONDITION ] call LARs_fnc_blacklistArsenal;

OBJECT - OBJECT to place arsenal action on.
[ WHITELIST, BLACKLIST ] - STRING, SIDE, ARRAY, where array can hold an of the previous types, STRING can also hold the name of a global variable or CfgPatches class. Passing true for the whitelist will provide all available gear from the config.
TARGETS - Target machines to add arsenal on, follows remoteExec conventions.
NAME - A unique name for the arsenal.
CONDITION - A CODE {} block holding the condition for displaying the arsenal action.

For white/blacklist's SIDE i have added some arrays of gear dynamically created at mission start from the config.
It iterates all soldiers to find their default gear ( weapons inc mags for all muzzles and accessories ), the contents of all their backpacks, gear from side specific crates. etc
Although not ideal it can give you a good base to start from and can be added to or subtracted from by using the lists.
The SIDEs although not particularly heavy ,are preinit behind the mission load, do involve itterating around the config so i have provided a description.ext variable
to enable them LARs_calculateSideGear = 1;

I have added a NAME to the parameters as you can know have multiple arsenals per box and will be displayed behind the word arsenal in the action.
This along with the features of TARGETS and CONDITION can lead to some powerful combinations.

Some examples..
JIPID = [ myBox, [ west ], west, "west" ] call LARs_fnc_blacklistArsenal;	//all west players see Arsenal - west, and contains only west items
JIPID = [ myBox, [ true, [ west, civilian ] ], east, "east" ] call LARs_fnc_blacklistArsenal;	//all east players see Arsenal - east, and contains east and independent items

launchers = [ "launch_B_Titan_short_F", "launch_I_Titan_short_F", "launch_O_Titan_short_F", "launch_B_Titan_F", "launch_I_Titan_F", "launch_O_Titan_F", "launch_NLAW_F", "launch_RPG32_F" ];
JIPID = [ myBox, [ west, "launchers" ], west, "No Launchers" ] call LARs_fnc_blacklistArsenal;
//All west players see Arsenal - No Launchers and contains all west gear minus specified launchers.

There are a few known issues like some backpacks having wierd loadouts and ive noticed ugl shells and flares are missing although all smokes show.
As for the definition of SIDEs gear this is unlikely to change other than a few oddities i may fix, but because of the limited data to search on without writing out fixed lists this is about as good as its going to get.
